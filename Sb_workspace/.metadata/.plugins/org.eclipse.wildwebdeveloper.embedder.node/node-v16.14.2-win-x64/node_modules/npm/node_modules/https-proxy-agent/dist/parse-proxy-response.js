\fBworkspaces\fR \- Working with workspaces
.SS Description
.P
\fBWorkspaces\fR is a generic term that refers to the set of features in the
npm cli that provides support to managing multiple packages from your local
file system from within a singular top\-level, root package\.
.P
This set of features makes up for a much more streamlined workflow handling
linked packages from the local file system\. Automating the linking process
as part of \fBnpm install\fP and avoiding manually having to use \fBnpm link\fP in
order to add references to packages that should be symlinked into the current
\fBnode_modules\fP folder\.
.P
We also refer to these packages being auto\-symlinked during \fBnpm install\fP as a
single \fBworkspace\fR, meaning it's a nested package within the current local
file system that is explicitly defined in the npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP
\fBworkspaces\fP configuration\.
.SS Defining workspaces
.P
Workspaces are usually defined via the \fBworkspaces\fP property of the
npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP file, e\.g:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "name": "my\-workspaces\-powered\-project",
  "workspaces": [
    "workspace\-a"
  ]
}
.fi
.RE
.P
Given the above \fBpackage\.json\fP example living at a current working
directory \fB\|\.\fP that contains a folder named \fBworkspace\-a\fP that itself contains
a \fBpackage\.json\fP inside it, defining a Node\.js package, e\.g:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
\|\.
+\-\- package\.json
`\-\- workspace\-a
   `\-\- package\.json
.fi
.RE
.P
The expected result once running \fBnpm install\fP in this current working
directory \fB\|\.\fP is that the folder \fBworkspace\-a\fP will get symlinked to the
\fBnode_modules\fP folder of the current working dir\.
.P
Below is a post \fBnpm install\fP example, given that same previous example
structure of files and folders:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
\|\.
+\-\- node_modules
|  `\-\- workspace\-a \-> \.\./workspace\-a
+\-\- package\-lock\.json
+\-\- package\.json
`\-\- workspace\-a
   `\-\- package\.json
.fi
.RE
.SS Getting started with workspaces
.P
You may automate the required steps to define a new workspace using
npm help init\. For example in a project that already has a
\fBpackage\.json\fP defined you can run:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm init \-w \./packages/a
.fi
.RE
.P
This command will create the missing folders and a new \fBpackage\.json\fP
file (if needed) while also making sure to properly configure the
