oy_a_Directory_or_War_from_the_Host_appBase">Deploy a Directory or War from the Host appBase</h4><div class="text">

<p>Deploy a web application directory or ".war" file located in your Host
appBase directory. The path and optional version are derived from the directory
or war file name.</p>

<p>In this example the web application located in a sub directory named
<code>foo</code> in the Host appBase directory of the Tomcat server is
deployed as the web application context named <code>/foo</code>. Notice
that the context path used is the name of the web application directory.</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://localhost:8080/manager/text/deploy?war=foo</code></pre></div>


<p>In this example the ".war" file <code>bar.war</code> located in your
Host appBase directory on the Tomcat server is deployed as the web
application context named <code>/bar</code>.</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://localhost:8080/manager/text/deploy?war=bar.war</code></pre></div>

<div class="subsection"><h4 id="Deploy_using_a_Context_configuration_&quot;.xml&quot;_file">Deploy using a Context configuration ".xml" file</h4><div class="text">

<p>If the Host deployXML flag is set to true you can deploy a web
application using a Context configuration ".xml" file and an optional
".war" file or web application directory. The context <code>path</code>
is not used when deploying a web application using a context ".xml"
configuration file.</p>

<p>A Context configuration ".xml" file can contain valid XML for a
web application Context just as if it were configured in your
Tomcat <code>server.xml</code> configuration file. Here is an
example:</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>&lt;Context path="/foobar" docBase="/path/to/application/foobar"&gt;
&lt;/Context&gt;</code></pre></div>


<p>When the optional <code>war</code> parameter is set to the URL
for a web application ".war" file or directory it overrides any
docBase configured in the context configuration ".xml" file.</p>

<p>Here is an example of deploying an application using a Context
configuration ".xml" file.</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://localhost:8080/manager/text/deploy?config=file:/path/context.xml</code></pre></div>


<p>Here is an example of deploying an application using a Context
configuration ".xml" file and a web application ".war" file located
on the server.</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://localhost:8080/manager/text/deploy

<p>If the Host is configured with unpackWARs=true and you deploy a war
file, the war will be unpacked into a directory in your Host appBase
directory.</p>

<p>If the application war or directory is installed in your Host appBase
directory and either the Host is configured with autoDeploy=true or the
Context path must match the directory name or war file name without the
".war" extension.</p>

<p>For security when untrusted users can manage web applications, the
Host deployXML flag can be set to false.  This prevents untrusted users
from deploying web applications using a configuration XML file and
also prevents them from deploying application directories or ".war"
files located outside of their Host appBase.</p>

<p>If installation and startup is successful, you will receive a response
like this:</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>OK - Deployed application at context path /foo</code></pre></div>

<p>Otherwise, the response will start with <code>FAIL</code> and include an
error message.  Possible causes for problems include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Application already exists at path /foo</em>
    <p>The context paths for all currently running web applications must be
    unique.  Therefore, you must undeploy the existing web
    application using this context path, or choose a different context path
    for the new one. The <code>update</code> parameter may be specified as
    a parameter on the URL, with a value of <code>true</code> to avoid this
    error. In that case, an undeploy will be performed on an existing
    application before performing the deployment.</p>
    </li>
<li><em>Document base does not exist or is not a readable directory</em>
    <p>The URL specified by the <code>war</code> parameter must identify a
    directory on this server that contains the "unpacked" version of a
    web application, or the absolute URL of a web application archive (WAR)
    file that contains this application.  Correct the value specified by
    the <code>war</code> parameter.</p>
    </li>
<li><em>Encountered exception</em>
    <p>An exception was encountered trying to start the new web application.
    Check the Tomcat logs for the details, but likely explanations include
    problems parsing your <code>/WEB-INF/web.xml</code> file, or missing
    classes encountered when initializing application event listeners and
    filters.</p>
    </li>
<li><em>Invalid application URL was specified</em>
    <p>The URL for the directory or web application that you specified
    was not valid.  Such URLs must start with <code>file:</code>, and URLs
    for a WAR file must end in ".war".</p>
    </li>
<li><em>Invalid context path was specified</em>
    <p>The context path must start with a slash character. To reference the
    ROOT web application use "/".</p>
    </li>
<li><em>Context path must match the directory or WAR file name:</em>
    <p>If the application war or directory is installed in your Host appBase
    directory and either the Host is configured with autoDeploy=true the
    Context path must match the directory name or war file name without
    the ".war" extension.</p>
    </li>
<li><em>Only web applications in the Host web application directory can
     be installed</em>
     <p>
     If the Host deployXML flag is set to false this error will happen
     if an attempt is made to deploy a web application directory or
      ".war" file outside of the Host appBase directory.

<p>Signal an existing application to shut itself down and reload.  This can
be useful when the web application context is not reloadable and you have
updated classes or property files in the <code>/WEB-INF/classes</code>
directory or when you have added or updated jar files in the

<p>The find leaks diagnostic attempts to identify web applications that have

should always be confirmed
with a profiler. The diagnostic uses additional functionality provided by the
StandardHost implementation. It will not work if a custom host is used that
does not extend StandardHost.</p>

<p>Explicitly triggering a full garbage collection from Java code is documented
to be unreliable. Furthermore, depending on the JVM used, there are options to
disable explicit GC triggering, like <code>-XX:+DisableExplicitGC</code>.
If you want to make sure, that the diagnostics were successfully running a full

        keep the connection alive or "Ready" if "Keep-Alive" is not
        appropriate.</p></li>
        <li><p><em>"Keep-Alive"</em> : The thread keeps the connection open to
        the client in case the client sends another request. If another request
        is received, the next stage will be "Parse and Prepare Request". If no
        request is received before the keep alive times out, the connection will
        be closed and the next stage will be "Ready".</p></li>

  <div class="subsection"><h4 id="What_is_JMX_Proxy_Servlet">What is JMX Proxy Servlet</h4><div class="text">
    The JMX Proxy Servlet is a lightweight proxy to get and set the
    tomcat internals. (Or any class that has been exposed via an MBean)
    Its usage is not very user friendly but the UI is
    extremely helpful for integrating command line scripts for monitoring
    and changing the internals of tomcat. You can do two things with the proxy:
    get information and set information. For you to really understand the
    JMX Proxy Servlet, you should have a general understanding of JMX.
    If you don't know what JMX is, then prepare to be confused.
  </div></div>

  <div class="subsection"><h4 id="JMX_Query_command">JMX Query command</h4><div class="text">
    <p>This takes the form:</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://webserver/manager/jmxproxy/?qry=STUFF</code></pre></div>
    <p>Where <code>STUFF</code> is the JMX query you wish to perform. For example,
    here are some queries you might wish to run:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>qry=*%3Atype%3DRequestProcessor%2C* --&gt;
         type=RequestProcessor</code> which will locate all
         workers which can process requests and report
         their state.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>qry=*%3Aj2eeType=Servlet%2c* --&gt;
            j2eeType=Servlet</code> which return all loaded servlets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>qry=Catalina%3Atype%3DEnvironment%2Cresourcetype%3DGlobal%2Cname%3DsimpleValue --&gt;
            Catalina:type=Environment,resourcetype=Global,name=simpleValue</code>
            which look for a specific MBean by the given name.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    You'll need to experiment with this to really understand its capabilities
    If you provide no <code>qry</code> parameter, then all of the MBeans will
    be displayed. We really recommend looking at the tomcat source code and
    understand the JMX spec to get a better understanding of all the queries
    you may run.
    </p>
  </div></div>

  <div class="subsection"><h4 id="JMX_Get_command">JMX Get command</h4><div class="text">
  <p>
    The JXMProxyServlet also supports a "get" command that you can use to
    fetch the value of a specific MBean's attribute. The general form of
    the <code>get</code> command is:
  </p>

<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://webserver/manager/jmxproxy/?get=BEANNAME&amp;att=MYATTRIBUTE&amp;key=MYKEY</code></pre></div>

    <p>You must provide the following parameters:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>get</code>: The full bean name</li>
      <li><code>att</code>: The attribute you wish to fetch</li>
      <li><code>key</code>: (optional) The key into a CompositeData MBean attribute</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    If all goes well, then it will say OK, otherwise an error message will
    be shown. For example, let's say we wish to fetch the current heap memory
    data:
    </p>

<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://webserver/manager/jmxproxy/?get=java.lang:type=Memory&amp;att=HeapMemoryUsage</code></pre></div>

    <p>Or, if you only want the "used" key:</p>

<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://webserver/manager/jmxproxy/
 ?get=java.lang:type=Memory&amp;att=HeapMemoryUsage&amp;key=used</code></pre></div>
  </div></div>

  <div class="subsection"><h4 id="JMX_Set_command">JMX Set command</h4><div class="text">
    <p>
    Now that you can query an MBean, its time to muck with Tomcat's internals!
    The general form of the set command is :
    </p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://webserver/manager/jmxproxy/?set=BEANNAME&amp;att=MYATTRIBUTE&amp;val=NEWVALUE</code></pre></div>
    <p>So you need to provide 3 request parameters:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>set</code>: The full bean name</li>
      <li><code>att</code>: The attribute you wish to alter</li>
      <li><code>val</code>: The new value </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    If all goes ok, then it will say OK, otherwise an error message will be
    shown. For example, lets say we wish to turn up debugging on the fly for the
    <code>ErrorReportValve</code>. The following will set debugging to 10.
    </p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://localhost:8080/manager/jmxproxy/
 ?set=Catalina%3Atype%3DValve%2Cname%3DErrorReportValve%2Chost%3Dlocalhost
 &amp;att=debug&amp;val=10</code></pre></div>
    <p>and my result is (YMMV):</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>Result: ok</code></pre></div>

    <p>Here is what I see if I pass in a bad value. Here is the URL I used,
    I try set debugging equal to 'cow':</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://localhost:8080/manager/jmxproxy/
 ?set=Catalina%3Atype%3DValve%2Cname%3DErrorReportValve%2Chost%3Dlocalhost
 &amp;att=debug&amp;val=cow</code></pre></div>
    <p>When I try that, my result is</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>Error: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "cow"</code></pre></div>
  </div></div>

  <div class="subsection"><h4 id="JMX_Invoke_command">JMX Invoke command</h4><div class="text">
    <p>The <code>invoke</code> command enables methods to be called on MBeans. The
    general form of the command is:</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://webserver/manager/jmxproxy/
 ?invoke=BEANNAME&amp;op=METHODNAME&amp;ps=COMMASEPARATEDPARAMETERS</code></pre></div>
    <p>For example, to call the <code>findConnectors()</code> method of the
    <strong>Service</strong> use:</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>http://localhost:8080/manager/jmxproxy/
 ?invoke=Catalina%3Atype%3DService&amp;op=findConnectors&amp;ps=</code></pre></div>
  </div></div>
</div><h3 id="Executing_Manager_Commands_With_Ant">Executing Manager Commands With Ant</h3><div class="text">

<p>In addition to the ability to execute Manager commands via HTTP requests,
as documented above, Tomcat includes a convenient set of Task definitions
for the <em>Ant</em> (version 1.4 or later) build tool.  In order to use these
commands, you must perform the following setup operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the binary distribution of Ant from
    <a href="https://ant.apache.org">https://ant.apache.org</a>.
    You must use version <strong>1.4</strong> or later.</li>
<li>Install the Ant distribution in a convenient directory (called
    ANT_HOME in the remainder of these instructions).</li>
<li>Add the <code>$ANT_HOME/bin</code> directory to your <code>PATH</code>
    environment variable.</li>
<li>Configure at least one username/password combination in your Tomcat
    user database that includes the <code>manager-script</code> role.</li>
</ul>

<p>To use custom tasks within Ant, you must declare them first with an
<code>&lt;import&gt;</code> element.  Therefore, your <code>build.xml</code>
file might look something like this:</p>

<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>&lt;project name="My Application" default="compile" basedir="."&gt;

  &lt;!-- Configure the directory into which the web application is built --&gt;
  &lt;property name="build"    value="${basedir}/build"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Configure the context path for this application --&gt;
  &lt;property name="path"     value="/myapp"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Configure properties to access the Manager application --&gt;
  &lt;property name="url"      value="http://localhost:8080/manager/text"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="username" value="myusername"/&gt;
  &lt;property name="password" value="mypassword"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Configure the path to the Tomcat installation --&gt;
  &lt;property name="catalina.home" value="/usr/local/apache-tomcat"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Configure the custom Ant tasks for the Manager application --&gt;
  &lt;import file="${catalina.home}/bin/catalina-tasks.xml"/&gt;

  &lt;!-- Executable Targets --&gt;
  &lt;target name="compile" description="Compile web application"&gt;
    &lt;!-- ... construct web application in ${build} subdirectory, and
            generated a ${path}.war ... --&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name="deploy" description="Install web application"
          depends="compile"&gt;
    &lt;deploy url="${url}" username="${username}" password="${password}"
            path="${path}" war="file:${build}${path}.war"/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name="reload" description="Reload web application"
          depends="compile"&gt;
    &lt;reload  url="${url}" username="${username}" password="${password}"
            path="${path}"/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name="undeploy" description="Remove web application"&gt;
    &lt;undeploy url="${url}" username="${username}" password="${password}"
            path="${path}"/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;</code></pre></div>

<p>Note: The definition of the resources task via the import above will override
the resources datatype added in Ant 1.7. If you wish to use the resources
datatype you will need to use Ant's namespace support to modify
<code>catalina-tasks.xml</code> to assign the Tomcat tasks to their own
namespace.</p>

<p>Now, you can execute commands like <code>ant deploy</code> to deploy the
application to a running instance of Tomcat, or <code>ant reload</code> to
tell Tomcat to reload it.  Note also that most of the interesting values in
this <code>build.xml</code> file are defined as replaceable properties, so
you can override their values from the command line.  For example, you might
consider it a security risk to include the real manager password in your
<code>build.xml</code> file's source code.  To avoid this, omit the password
property, and specify it from the command line:</p>
<div class="codeBox"><pre><code>ant -Dpassword=secret deploy</code></pre></div>

<div class="subsection"><h4 id="Tasks_output_capture">Tasks output capture</h4><div class="text">

<p>Using <em>Ant</em> version <strong>1.6.2</strong> or later,
the Catalina tasks offer the option to capture their output in
properties or external files. They support directly the following subset of the
<code>&lt;redirector&gt;</code> type attributes:
</p>

<table class="defaultTable">
<tr>
<th>Attribute</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Required</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>output</td>
<td>Name of a file to which to write the output. If
the error stream is not also redirected to a file or property, it will
appear in this output.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>error</td>
<td>The file to which the standard error of the
command should be redirected.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>logError</td>
<td>This attribute is used when you wish to see
error output in Ant's log and you are redirecting output to a
file/property. The error output will not be included in the output
file/property. If you redirect error with the <i>error</i> or <i>errorProperty</i>
attributes, this will have no effect.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>append</td>
<td>Whether output and error files should be
appended to or overwritten. Defaults to <code>false</code>.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>createemptyfiles</td>
<td>Whether output and error files should be created
even when empty. Defaults to <code>true</code>.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>outputproperty</td>
<td>The name of a property in which the output of
the command should be stored. Unless the error stream is redirected to
a separate file or stream, this property will include the error output.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>errorproperty</td>
<td>The name of a property in which the standard
error of the command should be stored.</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A couple of additional attributes can also be specified:
</p>
<table class="defaultTable">
<tr>
<th>Attribute</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Required</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>alwaysLog</td>
<td>This attribute is used when you wish to see the
output you are capturing, appearing also in the Ant's log. It must not be
used unless you are capturing task output.
Defaults to <code>false</code>.
<em>This attribute will be supported directly by <code>&lt;redirector&gt;</code>
in Ant 1.6.3</em></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>failonerror</td>
<td>This attribute is used when you wish to avoid that
any manager command processing error terminates the ant execution. Defaults to <code>true</code>.
It must be set to <code>false</code>, if you want to capture error output,
otherwise execution will terminate before anything can be captured.
<br>
This attribute acts only on manager command execution,
any wrong or missing command attribute will still cause Ant execution termination.
</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">No</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>They also support the embedded <code>&lt;redirector&gt;</code> element
in which you can specify
its full set of attributes, but <code>input</code>, <code>inputstring</code> and
<code>inputencoding</code> that, even if accepted, are not used because they have
no meaning in this context.
Refer to <a href="https://ant.apache.org">ant manual</a> for details on
<code>&lt;redirector&gt;</code> element attributes.
</p>

<p>
Here is a sample build file extract that shows how this output redirection support
can be used:

<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> even if it doesn't make many sense, and is always a bad idea,
calling a Catalina task more than once,
badly set Ant tasks depends chains may cause that a task be called
more than once in the same Ant run, even if not intended to. A bit of caution should be exercised when you are
capturing output from that task, because this could lead to something unexpected:</p>
<ul>
<li>when capturing in a property you will find in it only the output from the <em>first</em> call, because
Ant properties are immutable and once set they cannot be changed,
</li>
<li>when capturing in a file, each run will overwrite it and you will find in it only the <em>last</em> call
output, unless you are using the <code>append="true"</code> attribute, in which case you will
see the output of each task call appended to the file.
</li>
</ul>
