This following link to www.eclipse.org should be commented out
or removed in final version of the 
"web version" of the readme, since it does not make sense to 
have there. But in the "product's readme" it will point people 
to "the latest version" since there _might_ be changes made 
after the release.
  <p>
    The latest version of this document can be found on the web at <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/readme_eclipse_4.25.php">Eclipse Release Notes 4.25</a>. There may or may
    not be changes made after the product is released. You can tell by checking the "last revised" date near the top of this page.
