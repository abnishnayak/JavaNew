4.25 is upwards workspace-compatible with earlier 3.x and 4.x versions of the Eclipse SDK unless noted. This means that workspaces and projects
    created with Eclipse SDK 4.24, 4.23, 4.22, 4.21, 4.20, 4.19, 4.18, 4.17, 4.16, 4.15, 4.14, 4.13, 4.12, 4.11, 4.10, 4.9, 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 and 4.4 can be successfully opened by Eclipse SDK 4.25 and upgraded to a 4.25 workspace. This includes both hidden metadata, which is localized to a
    particular workspace, as well as metadata files found within a workspace project (e.g., the .project file), which may propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories. Individual
    plug-ins developed for Eclipse SDK 4.25 should provide similar upwards compatibility for their
