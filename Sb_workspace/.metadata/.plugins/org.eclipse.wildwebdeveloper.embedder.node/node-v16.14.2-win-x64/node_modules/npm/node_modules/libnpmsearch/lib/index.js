// MessageChannels are desirable because they give direct access to the HTML
// task queue, are implemented in Internet Explorer 10, Safari 5.0-1, and Opera
// 11-12, and in web workers in many engines.
// Although message channels yield to any queued rendering and IO tasks, they
// would be better than imposing the 4ms delay of timers.
// However, they do not work reliably in Internet Explorer or Safari.

// Internet Explorer 10 is the only browser that has setImmediate but does
// not have MutationObservers.
// Although setImmediate yields to the browser's renderer, it would be
// preferrable to falling back to setTimeout since it does not have
// the minimum 4ms penalty.
// Unfortunately there appears to be a bug in Internet Explorer 10 Mobile (and
// Desktop to a lesser extent) that renders both setImmediate and
// MessageChannel useless for the purposes of ASAP.

// Timers are implemented universally.
// We fall back to timers in workers in most engines, and in foreground
// contexts in the following browsers.
// However, note that even this simple case requires nuances to operate in a
// broad spectrum of browsers.
