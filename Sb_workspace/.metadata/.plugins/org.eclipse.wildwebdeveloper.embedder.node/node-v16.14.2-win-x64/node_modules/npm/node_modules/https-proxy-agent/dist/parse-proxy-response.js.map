_modules\fP resolution allows for
\fBworkspaces\fR to enable a portable workflow for requiring each \fBworkspace\fR
in such a way that is also easy to npm help publish these
nested workspaces to be consumed elsewhere\.
.SS Running commands in the context of workspaces
.P
You can use the \fBworkspace\fP configuration option to run commands in the context
of a configured workspace\.
.P
Following is a quick example on how to use the \fBnpm run\fP command in the context
of nested workspaces\. For a project containing multiple workspaces, e\.g:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
\|\.
+\-\- package\.json
`\-\- packages
   +\-\- a
   |   `\-\- package\.json
   `\-\- b
       `\-\- package\.json
.fi
.RE
.P
By running a command using the \fBworkspace\fP option, it's possible to run the
given command in the context of that specific workspace\. e\.g:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm run test \-\-workspace=a
.fi
.RE
.P
This will run the \fBtest\fP script defined within the
\fB\|\./packages/a/package\.json\fP file\.
.P
Please note that you can also specify this argument multiple times in the
command\-line in order to target multiple workspaces, e\.g:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm run test \-\-workspace=a \-\-workspace=b
.fi
.RE
.P
It's also possible to use the \fBworkspaces\fP (plural) configuration option to
enable the same behavior but running that command in the context of \fBall\fR
configured workspaces\. e\.g:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm run test \-\-workspaces
.fi
.RE
.P
Will run the \fBtest\fP script in both \fB\|\./packages/a\fP and \fB\|\./packages/b\fP\|\.
.P
Commands will be run in each workspace in the order they appear in your \fBpackage\.json\fP
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "workspaces": [ "packages/a", "packages/b" ]
}
.fi

Order of run is different with:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "workspaces": [ "packages/b", "packages/a" ]
}
.fi
