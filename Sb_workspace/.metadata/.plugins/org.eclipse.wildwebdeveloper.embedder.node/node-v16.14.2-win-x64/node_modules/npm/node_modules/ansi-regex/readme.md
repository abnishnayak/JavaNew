      name="mozTocId534426">With new implementation of hi-dpi support we are directly working with GTK3. So the users may see non-uniform scaling when you use swt.autoScale and GDK_SCALE flags. 
      Workaround is to set the scalefactor in display settings.</a>

  <p>
    <a
      class="mozTocH4"
      name="mozTocId554428">Eclipse automatically scales images on high-DPI monitors based on the resolution of the monitor. However, this scaling works only with integer scaling factors like
      100%, 200% etc by default. So, at intermediate scaling factors like 150%, 175% etc., its likely that the icons and text are scaled differently as the text scaling is handled directly by the
      operating system.</a>
