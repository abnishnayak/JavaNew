<h4 id="validate-the-checksums-of-cached-packages">Validate the checksums of cached packages</h4>
<p>When an npm package is published, the publishing process generates a
checksum that npm uses at install time to verify that the package didn't
get corrupted in transit. <code>npm doctor</code> uses these checksums to validate the
package tarballs in your local cache (you can see where that cache is
located with <code>npm config get cache</code>). In the event that there are corrupt
packages in your cache, you should probably run <code>npm cache clean -f</code> and
reset the cache.</p>
