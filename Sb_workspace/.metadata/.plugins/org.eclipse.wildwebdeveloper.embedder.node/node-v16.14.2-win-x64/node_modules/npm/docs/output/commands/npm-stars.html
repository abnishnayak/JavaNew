#### `location`

* Default: "user" unless `--global` is passed, which will also set this value
  to "global"
* Type: "global", "user", or "project"

When passed to `npm config` this refers to which config file to use.

#### `lockfile-version`

* Default: Version 2 if no lockfile or current lockfile version less than or
  equal to 2, otherwise maintain current lockfile version
* Type: null, 1, 2, 3, "1", "2", or "3"

Set the lockfile format version to be used in package-lock.json and
npm-shrinkwrap-json files. Possible options are:

1: The lockfile version used by npm versions 5 and 6. Lacks some data that
is used during the install, resulting in slower and possibly less
deterministic installs. Prevents lockfile churn when interoperating with
older npm versions.

2: The default lockfile version used by npm version 7. Includes both the
version 1 lockfile data and version 3 lockfile data, for maximum determinism
and interoperability, at the expense of more bytes on disk.

3: Only the new lockfile information introduced in npm version 7. Smaller on
disk than lockfile version 2, but not interoperable with older npm versions.
Ideal if all users are on npm version 7 and higher.

#### `loglevel`

* Default: "notice"
* Type: "silent", "error", "warn", "notice", "http", "timing", "info",
  "verbose", or "silly"

What level of logs to report. All logs are written to a debug log, with the
path to that file printed if the execution of a command fails.

Any logs of a higher level than the setting are shown. The default is
"notice".

See also the `foreground-scripts` config.

combination).

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `message`

Commit message which is used by `npm version` when creating version commit.

Any "%s" in the message will be replaced with the version number.

<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `node-options`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

Options to pass through to Node.js via the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment
variable. This does not impact how npm itself is executed but it does impact
how lifecycle scripts are called.

<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `node-version`

* Default: Node.js `process.version` value
* Type: SemVer string

#### `npm-version`

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `offline`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Force offline mode: no network requests will be done during install. To
allow the CLI to fill in missing cache data, see `--prefer-offline`.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty.
* Type: "dev", "optional", or "peer" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk.

Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file. They are just not
physically installed on disk.

If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included.

If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycl
