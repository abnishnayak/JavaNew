#### `strict-peer-deps`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to `true`, and `--legacy-peer-deps` is not set, then _any_
conflicting `peerDependencies` will be treated as an install failure, even
if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer
dependency relationships.

By default, conflicting `peerDependencies` deep in the dependency graph will
be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if
doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside
the range set in their package's `peerDependencies` object.

When such and override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the
conflict and the packages involved. If `--strict-peer-deps` is set, then
this warning is treated as a failure.

#### `strict-ssl`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to do SSL key validation when making requests to the registry
via https.

See also the `ca` config.

#### `tag`

* Default: "latest"
* Type: String

If you ask npm to install a package and don't tell it a specific version,
then it will install the specified tag.

Also the tag that is added to the package@version specified by the `npm tag`
command, if no explicit tag is given.

When used by the `npm diff` command, this is the tag used to fetch the
tarball that will be compared with the local files by default.

<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `tag-version-prefix`

* Default: "v"
* Type: String

If set, alters the prefix used when tagging a new version when performing a
version increment using `npm-version`. To remove the prefix altogether, set
it to the empty string: `""`.

Because other tools may rely on the convention that npm version tags look
like `v1.0.0`, _only use this property if it is absolutely necessary_. In
particular, use care when overriding this setting for public packages.

#### `timing`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, writes an `npm-debug` log to `_logs` and timing information to
`_timing.json`, both in your cache, even if the command completes
successfully. `_timing.json` is a newline delimited list of JSON objects.

You can quickly view it with this [json](https://npm.im/json) command line:
`npm exec -- json -g < ~/.npm/_timing.json`.

#### `umask`

* Default: 0
* Type: Octal numeric string in range 0000..0777 (0..511)

The "umask" value to use when setting the file creation mode on files and
folders.

Folders and executables are given a mode which is `0o777` masked against
this value. Other files are given a mode which is `0o666` masked against
this value.

Note that the underlying system will _also_ apply its own umask value to
files and folders that are created, and npm does not circumvent this, but
rather adds the `--umask` config to it.

Thus, the effective default umask value on most POSIX systems is 0o22,
meaning that folders and executables are created with a mode of 0o755 and
other files are created with a mode of 0o644.

#### `unicode`

* Default: false on windows, true on mac/unix systems with a unicode locale,
  as defined by the `LC_ALL`, `LC_CTYPE`, or `LANG` environment variables.
* Type: Boolean

When set to true, npm uses unicode characters in the tree output. When
false, it uses ascii characters instead of unicode glyphs.

#### `update-notifier`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

Set to false to suppress the update notification when using an older version
of npm than the latest.

#### `usage`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Show short usage output about the command specified.

#### `user-agent`

* Default: "npm/{npm-version} node/{node-version} {platform} {arch}
  workspaces/{workspaces} {ci}"
* Type: String

Sets the User-Agent request header. The following fields are replaced with
their actual counterparts:

* `{npm-version}` - The npm version in use
* `{node-version}` - The Node.js version in use
* `{platform}` - The value of `process.platform`
* `{arch}` - The value of `process.arch`
* `{workspaces}` - Set to `true` if the `workspaces` or `workspace` options
  are set.
* `{ci}` - The value of the `ci-name` config, if set, prefixed with `ci/`, or
  an empty string if `ci-name` is empty.

<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `userconfig`

* Default: "~/.npmrc"
* Type: Path

The location of user-level configuration settings.

This may be overridden by the `npm_config_userconfig` environment variable
or the `--userconfig` command line option, but may _not_ be overridden by
settings in the `globalconfig` file.

<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `version`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, output the npm version and exit successfully.

Only relevant when specified explicitly on the command line.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `versions`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, output the npm version as well as node's `process.versions` map and
the version in the current working directory's `package.json` file if one
exists, and exit successfully.

Only relevant when specified explicitly on the command line.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `viewer`

* Default: "man" on Posix, "browser" on Windows
* Type: String

The program to use to view help content.

Set to `"browser"` to view html h
