with a '!':

```json
{
  "os": [
    "!win32"
  ]
}
```

The host operating system is determined by `process.platform`

It is allowed to both block and allow an item, although there isn't any
good reason to do this.

### cpu

If your code only runs on certain cpu architectures,
you can specify which ones.

```json
{
  "cpu": [
    "x64",
    "ia32"
  ]
}
```

Like the `os` option, you can also block architectures:

```json
{
  "cpu": [
    "!arm",
    "!mips"
  ]
}
```

The host architecture is determined by `process.arch`

### private

If you set `"private": true` in your package.json, then npm will refuse to
publish it.

This is a way to prevent accidental publication of private repositories.
If you would like to ensure that a given package is only ever published to
a specific registry (for example, an internal registry), then use the
`publishConfig` dictionary described below to override the `registry`
config param at publish-time.

### publishConfig

This is a set of config values
